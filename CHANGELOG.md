# Changelog

Version note (2026-09-13, updated 2026-10-17): `pyproject.toml` declares `0.1.10`; it was `0.1.0` while PyPI already had `0.1.1`. Existing entries below are historical development records, not a verified registry release inventory. The product-generation label “v1” is separate from package versioning. No new package version or release is created by this documentation reconciliation.

## Unreleased

- `RelationDoc.attributes`: a free dict of the edge's own attributes (a multiplicity, a role, a
  transition's action), written in the frontmatter and copied to the index edge as
  `metadata["attributes"]`. A RelationDoc written before has none. Its contract moved: run
  `sldb stores update` in a store that tracks RelationDoc documents.
- `sldb.api.StructuredNLDoc`: the base class of models, from the public surface.
- `sldb.api.graph.query_snapshot(snapshot, query)`: a StructuredQuery over a GraphSnapshot held
  in memory, no store needed. `sldb.api.graph` also exports `Edge` and `SystemIdentity`.
- `models inherit` and the `stores check` note tell a copy by its class, not by the reference
  string: `deskops.models.atom:AtomDoc` is a copy of `deskops.models:AtomDoc` when the package
  re-exports it. A converted copy takes the owner's `model_ref`.
- `edges check` over linked stores: one edge that two stores both emit (a shared model's
  `has_field`) counts once for cardinality; `has_model` is many-to-many, since stores share a
  model they inherit; `links_to` is a builtin relation type. `sldb edges init` now also
  rewrites a tracked builtin relation type whose spec moved (`updated` in its report), and no
  longer writes a builtin over an authored relation type of the same name.
- Models are defined once, in the store that owns them, and inherited by the others.
  `sldb models inherit alias:Model` / `sldb.api.inherit_model` registers an inherited entry
  (`origin: <alias>`, no source path) or converts a local copy in place, keeping its documents,
  roster and signed contract. Using `alias:Model` as a model name now inherits instead of
  copying. An inherited model imports from the owner's project root, so no `--pythonpath` is
  needed and a moved owner is one link to update; with the owner unreachable the store keeps
  working on its own signature. `stores check` notes a local model under a name a linked store
  owns (a convertible copy, or an override to rename). The graph gains `links_to` between
  stores and `origin_store` on `has_model`. A store with no inherited models writes no
  `origin` key, so existing indexes do not change.
- `stores update` re-signs the roster of a model whose class does not import. It used to skip
  the model whole, so a stale roster (a merge that brought its shards in, say) stayed
  `roster stale` in `stores check`. Its documents are still not rehashed, it is still reported
  as skipped, and it keeps the contract it signed.
- `stores check` no longer reports a moved contract for a model with `extra="allow"` (deskops'
  TaskDoc) whose documents carry undeclared frontmatter keys. Such a key is still produced by
  the current class, so it is not a field the model dropped; the check only counts a key the
  current extraction of the same document no longer yields. `stores update` could never clear
  the old finding.
- A template whose frontmatter is one `dict` placeholder (`⸢rev,dict•frontmatter⸥`) declares
  every key: `docs track` and `docs create` no longer refuse a document's extra keys, which that
  dict carries back on re-render.
- `producer.version` in a semantic export is the real package version: read from the source
  checkout's `pyproject.toml`, else from the installed `structuredLanguageDB` metadata. It
  asked for a distribution named `sldb`, which never exists, and always fell back to `0.1.0`.
- `click` is an optional extra (`pip install structuredLanguageDB[click]`), imported only when
  `ClickScanner` is used; it was imported unconditionally without being declared.
- `sldb.examples.pandoc_cv` ships in the wheel, with its Markdown files.
- `tools/check_identity.py` reads `git ls-files -z`: a quoted non-ASCII path no longer shows
  up as a top-level entry named `"docs`.

## 0.1.10 - 2026-10-17 — references to a relation type reach it; a document by absolute path

- A `__references__` field that points at `RelationTypeDoc:<doc>` now lands on the
  `sldb://relation_type/<name>` node. The index stores relation types under that node, so the
  schema edge used to point at a document node that does not exist and was dropped silently
  while `doc_exists` said yes. `resolve_edges` moves that end to the relation-type node.
- `find_doc` (behind untrack and delete) accepts a document's absolute path as well as the path
  relative to the project root.
- Design notes for the surface in `docs/surface/`, with tests for the MachineDoc editor and an
  optimistic-lock client. The editor test compiles on Python 3.10/3.11 (no nested PEP 701
  f-string).

## 0.1.9 - 2026-10-16 — a dropped field is a contract move, and `stores update` fixes it

- A document whose `field_hashes` name a field its model no longer declares was signed under
  another contract. Any write of another document of the model re-stamps the model's contract,
  so the model looked unmoved: `stores check` blamed the untouched document (`data_mutation`,
  "confirm the change was intended") and `stores update` trusted its unchanged text and never
  re-extracted it, so the check stayed red. Now the model reads as `contract moved` (safe to
  run: `stores update`) and `stores update` re-extracts those documents.

## 0.1.8 - 2026-10-16 — a deleted model class no longer locks the store

- Derived-index rebuilds skip a model whose class does not import instead of raising; the
  semantic rebuild names it in `models_unresolved`, as the edge rebuild already did, and its
  documents keep their last tags. `untrack_document` (and every write that rebuilds) works
  while another registered model's class is gone.
- `sldb models remove <name> --with-documents` / `remove_model(..., untrack_documents=True)`:
  drops a model and its tracked documents without importing the class; the Markdown files stay.
- A write that raises halfway leaves no trace: `untrack_document` puts the document's shard,
  the models index and the store index back as they were; `remove_model` changes the registry
  first and deletes the model's files only once every rebuild succeeded.

## 0.1.7 - 2026-10-16 — `models remove`

- `sldb models remove <name>` / `sldb.api.remove_model(store, name)`: unregisters a model that
  tracks no documents, with its indexes and shards; the class is never imported, so a model
  whose code was deleted can go. A model that still tracks documents is refused (untrack them
  first). `stores check` already passes with such a model registered (0.1.5); its note now
  names the unimportable models with no documents as removable.

## 0.1.6 - 2026-10-16 — the graph as a state machine

- `--where` joins predicates with ` and ` (outside literals; no `or`, no parentheses), and
  `nonempty(f)` is `has(f)` that also rejects `[]` and `{}` (`has` keeps its meaning).
- `sldb.api.where_matches(expression, payload, subject=None)`: a `--where` predicate on a plain
  payload, tracked or not; `{field}` fills from `subject` (default: the payload). An unparseable
  part raises `WherePredicateError`, now exported from `sldb.api`.
- `sldb.api.edges_holding(store, node, subject, relation=None)`: the edges leaving a node whose
  condition (the edge's, else its type's) holds on the subject; `sldb edges show <node>
  --holds-for <doc>` is the same from the CLI. A self-loop is a valid edge (a terminal
  transition).

## 0.1.5 - 2026-10-16 — an unimportable model is named, not blamed on its documents

- `stores check`: when a model's class cannot be imported (a clean clone without the model's
  package, a consumer's CI with another `sldb` first on PATH), its fields cannot be
  re-extracted. Every document used to read as a `data_mutation` ("decide first", restore the
  file). Intact text now stands for intact fields, and the report names the unresolved models;
  changed text still fails. JSON: `models[].resolved`.
- CI: the structural gates pass (`legacy_contract` mapped to the `migracion` axis, unit coupling
  updated; the surface gate no longer compares the five-consumer total with a partial view),
  and `selfdoc check` passes (knowledge/ synced with the CLI, the store committed with it).

## 0.1.4 - 2026-10-16 — `fields update` leaves the store passing

- A field write (`fields update|append`, `sldb.api.save_document_payload`) rewrote the Markdown
  and the model's roster but not the document's record, so `stores check` failed with a
  `data_mutation` on the write sldb had just made. The shard cache handed out its own instance:
  the caller edited it in place and the save, comparing against the cache, saw no change and
  skipped the write. Loads now return a copy (`sldb.store.io.shards`), which also covers the
  semantic, sections and edges shards.

## 0.1.3 - 2026-10-16 — upgrading sldb no longer fails unchanged stores

Found on Governance's `pulse`, which installs sldb from git: both checks failed on a store whose
content had not changed.

- `stores check`: a model whose stored contract hash equals the formula sldb used before
  cecd97b (fields and template only) passes, with a note naming those models, instead of
  "contract moved" on every model. A class that really changed still fails. `stores update`
  re-seals the hash under the current formula. JSON: `models[].legacy_contract`.
- `edges check`: in a store that ran `edges init`, an edge sldb derives itself whose builtin
  type was added later (`composes`) is checked against the definition sldb ships and reported in
  `untracked_builtins`, not as an error. A store that never ran `edges init` still fails;
  authored edges still need a tracked type.

## 0.1.2 - 2026-10-16 — referencing documents of linked stores

- `stores add` links were recorded but no document lookup read them: `docs show
  alias:doc` answered `Unknown document target`. `docs show` (and `sections show|fields`,
  serve's document routes) now take `alias:ref` — name, `Model/name` or tracked path — and
  read only the store linked directly as `alias`. A bare ref still reads only the local store;
  a prefix that names no link leaves the ref whole, so existing refs resolve as before.
- Add `docs exists <[alias:]ref>` and `sldb.api.doc_status|doc_exists`: whether a reference
  resolves, from the indexes alone (no model import, nothing written). Exit 0 ok, 1 missing,
  2 ambiguous, 5 `link-missing` / `link-broken`, so a missing document is told apart from a
  sibling repo that is not there.
- `stores list` (and `sldb.api.store_links`) report each link's state: `ok`, `missing` or
  `not-a-store`; a broken link is reported, never raised.
- `stores add` records the link relative to the project root (it was absolute outside it), and
  refuses linking a store to itself, aliases outside `[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]*` and the
  reserved `local`. Links already written are read as before.
- `stores init` seals the root hash over the empty model layer: a new store, or one that
  only links others, passes `stores check` without a `stores update`.
- `docs show` of a linked doc reads its file from the linked project (`absolute_path` was
  built from the local root).

## 2026-10-01 — SLDB is the substrate again

- The README no longer calls this generation frozen: the v2 seed (`knowledge`) was frozen in
  turn and its evaluator moved to `pron`, so nothing supersedes this package. SLDB is the
  store every surface (`surface/`, `tools/graph_ui`, `tools/sldb-ui`) is a view over. <!-- gone -->
- New README section "Serving and surfaces": `sldb serve` routes grouped by what a UI needs,
  and where the surfaces and their design docs live.

## 2026-09-07 — v1 frozen

- The README marks this generation frozen, with `knowledge` as its successor. Earlier modularization and v0.6 removal plans are historical and do not promise further v1 releases.

## Working tree — `docs delete`

- Add `docs delete` (and `sldb.api.delete_document`): untrack a document **and** remove
  its Markdown file. `docs untrack` was the only way to drop a document, and it keeps
  the file on purpose — so "delete this document" meant untrack, then `rm` by hand, then
  remember that `runtime/cache/extracted.json` still describes the deleted path until
  some later full load rewrites it. `delete` does the three.
- Confirms before removing the file unless `--yes` is given; a non-interactive stdin
  answers no.
- Add `runtime_cache_disk.forget(store, predicate)` so cache entries can be dropped
  without a full store load.

## Working tree — self-documentation follow-up

- Add `selfdoc scan|sync|check` to derive CLI facts from argparse, preserve authored explanations, and synchronize tracked command/surface documents from the selected store root.
- Report obsolete documents without deleting them; check freshness without writing documents or indexes.
- Expose public parser help for the supported `init` and `example` commands.
- Split knowledge document definitions into one class per file, keeping public import references and resolving re-exported definitions for template editing.
- Separate follow-up work into self-documentation, store context/federation, and AST ownership/section contracts. No package version bump or publication is included.

## Historical pending changes

- Add reversible `rev,table[...]` template markers for rendering and extracting Markdown tables backed by `list[dict]` fields.
- Add generic cross-store document writes through linked store aliases and federated model namespaces for workflow tools such as `deskops`.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-05-16

- **Store write concurrency**: atomic writes + advisory `fcntl` locks on all index write paths; `--wait` flag for `stores update`
- **Rebuild auditability**: `RebuildReport` dataclass tracks missing docs, empty sections, and unparseable headings in both semantic and section rebuilds; `--verbose` flag for details
- **CLI deprecation surface**: old singular commands (`store`, `model`, `doc`, `ls`, `get`, etc.) emit deprecation warnings; v0.6 was the historical removal target (see freeze note above).
- **Read-side hot path**: `sections show` and `sections fields` prefer persisted index over full IR rebuild; `--rebuild` flag available on `find`/`sections find`
- **Marker ownership robustness**: field name from the canonical `parse_marker()` is validated against known payload paths; unknown markers log a warning

## 0.1.2 - 2026-04-24

- Reorganize the package into `core`, `models`, `runtime`, `cli`, `assets`, and `examples` subpackages while keeping compatibility re-exports
- Add explicit link recovery and transclusion composition with `recover` and `compose`
- Add structural store queries under `st` with `ls`, `get`, `glob`, and `find --where`
- Add store-local semantic indexing under `se` and explicit federated semantic navigation under `gse`
- Add model semantic metadata, canonical model registration, semantic equivalence mapping, and bundled tests for the new workflows

## 0.1.1 - 2026-04-24

- Add current-system architecture docs and diagrams under `docs/architecture/`
- Add feature proposal docs under `desk/` for future SLDB features: link/recover/compose, store tree indexing, semantic DAG indexing, canonical/global-local semantics
- Add desk workspace with task board, self-docs, and operating procedures

## 0.1.0 - 2026-04-21

- Rename the package and CLI from `nldb` to `sldb`
- Add safe-by-default Python marker execution with configurable unsafe mode
- Ship the SLDB example bundle and CLI workflows for extract, render, validate, init, and example
- Add release basics: MIT license, package metadata, and CI
