# SLDB FAQ

This FAQ is the first-use orientation layer for SLDB. It answers the most common onboarding questions directly and points to the atom docs under `docs/atoms/` when you need the durable definition behind each answer.

## How do I run the CLI correctly?

Run it as `sldb ...` or `python -m sldb ...`.

Do not run `bash sldb ...`. `sldb` is a CLI entrypoint, not a shell script.

Examples:

```bash
sldb help
python -m sldb help docs
```

## What exactly is a store?

A store is SLDB's metadata workspace for model registrations, tracked document indexes, integrity hashes, semantic artifacts, and section indexes. It does not replace your Markdown files and it does not become the canonical source-of-truth for the document text.

See the durable definition in the [Store atom](atoms/store.atom.md).

## Is `.sldb/` required?

No, not for every operation.

- You can use direct model commands such as `extract`, `render`, and `validate` without a store.
- You do need a store when you want model registration, tracked docs, project-level queries, semantic search, section indexes, or integrity checks.
- The normal project-local workflow uses `.sldb/`.
- A global `~/.sldb/` can also exist, and the local store wins when both exist.

## What files live inside the store?

Today the docs describe these current store surfaces:

- model registrations and per-model indexes
- tracked document indexes
- integrity hashes
- semantic artifacts and section indexes

In this repo's current layout, that means files under `.sldb/core/` plus rebuildable runtime artifacts under `.sldb/runtime/`.

In practical terms, the store holds metadata about documents, not the documents themselves.

## What does `semantic` vs `physical` mean?

`physical` means concrete names and structure such as paths, tracked doc names, section titles, and field paths.

`semantic` means concept-like information such as explicit semantic tags and derived section meaning.

Use `physical` when you know something path-like. Use `semantic` when you know something meaning-like.

Examples:

```bash
sldb find roadmap --in physical
sldb find type.documentation.architecture --in semantic
```

See the [Semantic vs Physical Search atom](atoms/semantic-vs-physical.atom.md).

## What format does `models add` expect?

It expects a Python import reference in the form `module:ClassName`.

Examples:

```bash
sldb models add myapp.docs:Book --store .sldb --pythonpath src
sldb models add docs.models:FAQDoc --store .sldb --pythonpath .
```

It does not take a raw file path as the model identifier. If the module is not importable from the default Python path, pass `--pythonpath`.

See the [Model Reference atom](atoms/model-reference.atom.md).

## How do I see which models are already registered?

Use `sldb models list`.

Examples:

```bash
sldb models list --store .sldb
sldb models list --store ~/.sldb --format yaml
```

If you run a store-based command outside a repo with a local `.sldb/`, SLDB will now tell you whether it found a global `~/.sldb/` and whether you should pass `--store` explicitly.

## Can SLDB model Pandoc fenced CV docs without redesigning them?

Yes, at the shallow `title + body` level.

If the CV already uses Pandoc fenced div blocks such as `::: {.job ...}` and `::: {.education ...}`, SLDB can preserve and round-trip those blocks as part of the body field without flattening the format.

Recommended pattern:

- keep the document model shallow, usually `title + body`
- keep one short lead paragraph after the H1 before the first fenced div
- let downstream tools continue parsing the fenced div attributes structurally

Current limit:

- SLDB does not yet treat fenced div attributes as first-class typed fields on its own
- if you need `role`, `org`, `dates`, and similar attributes as typed fields, use a custom model or handler strategy for that document family

Minimal example:

```bash
python -m sldb validate sldb.examples.pandoc_cv.cv_model:PandocCVDoc --input src/sldb/examples/pandoc_cv/cv.input.md --pythonpath .
```

## What identifier do tracked docs use?

A tracked doc has a logical store name plus a physical file path.

Depending on the command, SLDB may accept one of these forms:

- the tracked doc name, such as `roadmap`
- the qualified form, such as `RoadmapDoc/roadmap`
- the physical path, such as `docs/roadmap.md`

The key distinction is:

- physical path = where the Markdown file lives
- tracked doc name = the logical handle inside the store

Use `--name` when you want explicit control over the tracked name instead of relying on derived defaults.

See the [Tracked Document atom](atoms/tracked-document.atom.md).

## What is the difference between `docs create`, `track`, `update`, `recover`, and `compose`?

They do different jobs:

- `docs create`: render a new Markdown file from a registered model plus payload data, then track it
- `docs track`: validate and register an existing Markdown file
- `docs update`: re-render an already tracked doc with new payload data
- `docs recover`: resolve `[[links]]` and `[predicate:: [[links]]]`, then report their targets and registered predicate axes
- `docs compose`: expand `![[transclusions]]` into a composed output

Predicate definitions belong to the selected store and are managed through `sldb predicates add|list|show|validate|remove`.

The important distinction is that `recover` and `compose` are link/transclusion commands, not payload extraction commands.

See the [Compose vs Recover atom](atoms/compose-vs-recover.atom.md) and [Predicate Links atom](atoms/predicate-links.atom.md).

## What is a `StructuredNLDoc` model?

It is the typed document contract used by SLDB.

It defines:

- the Markdown template
- the Pydantic fields
- the field descriptions
- optional semantics

That contract is what makes `Markdown -> payload -> Markdown` workflows possible.

See the [StructuredNLDoc Model atom](atoms/structurednldoc-model.atom.md).

## What inputs does `docs create` accept?

`docs create` renders from a registered model plus payload data.

The payload can be:

- inline JSON or YAML
- a JSON or YAML file path

Examples:

```bash
sldb docs create --model Book -o docs/book.md '{"title":"My Book"}'
sldb docs create --model Book -o docs/book.md data.yaml
```

It does not generate a template on its own. The template already lives in the registered model.

See the [Payload Inputs atom](atoms/payload-inputs.atom.md).

## How do I interact with the store in practice?

The normal lifecycle is:

```bash
sldb stores init --path .
sldb models add myapp.docs:Book --store .sldb --pythonpath src
sldb docs create --model Book -o docs/book.md data.yaml --store .sldb --pythonpath src
sldb stores check --store .sldb
sldb stores update --store .sldb --pythonpath src
```

Use `stores check` when you want integrity diagnostics. Use `stores update` after bulk changes or when section and semantic indexes need a rebuild.

## How do I inspect the AST, and when should I use it?

Use `ast show` when you want to inspect how SLDB currently understands a store, model, document, section hierarchy, or field ownership.

Examples:

```bash
sldb ast show
sldb ast show models/Book
sldb ast show docs/roadmap
```

This is the best debugging surface when `find`, `sections`, or field ownership results do not match your mental model.

See the [AST View atom](atoms/ast-view.atom.md).

## How do I get data out of SLDB?

There are several ways, depending on the level you want:

- `extract`: get payload from one Markdown file using a direct model ref
- `docs show`: inspect a tracked document payload and AST
- `fields show`: inspect one field schema or one field value
- `fields query`: query the same field path across tracked docs
- `find`: retrieve docs, sections, and fields semantically or physically
- `ast show`: inspect the normalized graph view
- `stores semantic-export`: emit the graph-ready SLDB semantic payload for KGDB ingestion

Examples:

```bash
sldb extract myapp.docs:Book docs/book.md output.yaml
sldb docs show my-book --store .sldb --format yaml
sldb fields query title --store .sldb --format yaml
sldb stores semantic-export --store .sldb --pythonpath src --format kgdb --encoding json -o kgdb.semantic.json
```

`stores semantic-export` differs from semantic search: it exports SLDB's semantic document truth in bulk for a graph consumer, while `find --in semantic` answers a specific retrieval query. The export does not add source-file dependency edges or workflow-specific relations; those belong to downstream graph adapters.

## How do I read one field without opening the Markdown?

Name it by address. The store knows the document's path and model, the model's template knows where the field lives, and SLDB returns the value.

```bash
sldb fields show docs/my-book/title --store .sldb
sldb legacy get 'st.{Book}.my-book.title' --format text --store .sldb
sldb legacy ls 'st.{Book}.my-book' --store .sldb          # fields with their descriptions
```

`docs/<doc>/<field>` and `st.{Model}.<doc>.<field>` are two spellings of the same address. Dotted field paths reach into dict fields (`metadata.author`).

See the [Address Space atom](atoms/address-space.atom.md) and [`addressability_model.md`](addressability_model.md).

## How do I get every document of a family where a field has some value?

One command, scoped to the family and filtered by one predicate:

```bash
sldb legacy find 'st.{Note+}' --where 'status = "open"' --store .sldb
sldb find "" --in physical --type doc --where 'model <= Note' --store .sldb
sldb fields query status --global --store .sldb              # the value of one field everywhere
```

`{Note+}` means `Note` and every subclass; the base does not need to be registered or have documents of its own. The predicate grammar is `has(f)`, `"x" in f`, `f ~ "regex"`, `f = "v"`, `f != "v"`, `f >= n`, `f <= n`, `model <= Base`, one per `--where`.

## How do I update data in tracked docs?

Use the smallest command that matches the change you want:

- `docs update` when you want to re-render the full tracked document from payload data
- `fields update` when you want to change one existing field value
- `fields create` when the field path is missing and should be created
- `fields append` when the target is a list field
- `fields clean` when you want to normalize a list field

Examples:

```bash
sldb docs update my-book '{"title":"Updated Title"}' --store .sldb
sldb fields update docs/my-book/title '"Updated Title"' --store .sldb
sldb fields append docs/my-book/tags '"dessert"' --store .sldb
```

You never edit the Markdown for these. SLDB re-renders the whole document from the updated payload, checks that it extracts back to the same payload, writes the file, updates `hash_c` and `hash_d`, rebuilds the semantic index and cascades `hash_a`. A write that would break the roundtrip is refused.

## When should I use `compose` vs `recover`?

Use `recover` when your question is "what links are here and do they resolve?"

Use `compose` when your question is "what does this document look like after transclusions are expanded?"

Examples:

```bash
sldb docs recover roadmap --store .sldb
sldb docs compose roadmap --store .sldb -o -
```

## Should SLDB provide structured reference and materialization fields?

Not as required core fields today.

SLDB should stay generic: it owns structured Markdown contracts, tracked document identity, validation, composition, semantic indexes, and semantic export. Workflow-specific concepts such as source atoms, materialization outputs, validation hooks, and role-specific references should usually live in project models or downstream workflow systems such as `deskops`.

Use explicit fields in your own `StructuredNLDoc` model when a project needs metadata such as `source_atoms`, `output_kind`, `output`, or `validates_with`. Promote a pattern into SLDB only when it is reusable across unrelated projects and does not encode one workflow domain.

## How should I model large composed documents?

Start shallow unless you need typed structure.

Use a `title + body` style model for large READMEs, FAQs, architecture docs, and narrative documents when SLDB only needs to preserve, validate, track, and search the document as a whole.

Use typed fields or typed section models when code needs to query or update specific parts independently. Use `docs compose` when a human-facing document should expand explicit transclusions from other tracked documents.

Do not store reverse use-site lists inside the source documents by default. Prefer forward references in the composed/materialized document and let the store, semantic export, or downstream graph adapters answer reverse questions.

## Should SLDB emit graph-ready payloads for KGDB?

Yes, through the semantic export boundary.

Use `sldb stores semantic-export` to emit SLDB-owned semantic document truth for graph consumers. The export includes model entries, document entries, sections, semantic tags, semantic DAG relationships, equivalences, and store/hash provenance.

SLDB should not emit workflow-specific graph edges or source-code dependency edges as part of that semantic truth. Downstream adapters such as `deskops` or KGDB can add those edges after ingesting the export.

See [Semantic Export Boundary](architecture/semantic-export-boundary.md).

## What should a first-time workflow look like?

If you are evaluating SLDB for the first time:

1. Read `sldb help` and `sldb help docs`.
2. Inspect this repo's [atom docs](atoms/) if a core concept is still unclear.
3. Create a simple `StructuredNLDoc` model with good field descriptions.
4. Run `sldb validate <module:Class> --data data.yaml` or `--input doc.md`.
5. Initialize a store only when you need tracked docs and project-level queries.
6. Use `find`, `sections`, and `ast show` once the store exists.

If you want deeper written guidance from the CLI, use `sldb explore <term>`.

## Is there a CLI command for browsing the FAQ one question at a time?

Yes. Use `sldb faq`.

- `sldb faq` lists the available questions
- `sldb faq 2` shows one question by number
- `sldb faq semantic` shows the first question whose slug or text matches `semantic`

Examples:

```bash
sldb faq
sldb faq store
sldb faq semantic --format yaml
```

This is useful when you want entry-level onboarding help without scanning the whole file.

## Is there a CLI command for logging unclear points or suggestions?

Yes. Use `sldb inbox`.

This command writes a timestamped markdown note into the target project's `desk/inbox/` so confusion and improvement ideas land in the right workspace instead of disappearing into chat history.
If the project already has a store and a registered `InboxNoteDoc`, the note is also auto-tracked into that store.

Examples:

```bash
sldb inbox "The docs still do not define tracked doc names clearly" --kind unclear
sldb inbox "Add more examples for docs update" --kind suggestion --title "docs update examples"
sldb inbox --list
sldb inbox --show tracked-doc-names
```

The note body must contain at least one short explanatory sentence. Title-only placeholders such as `Repo-targeted note` are rejected so the inbox stays actionable.

Use `--kind unclear` for unresolved confusion and `--kind suggestion` for proposed improvements.
If you need to force a different target, pass `--desk-root` explicitly or `--store` to anchor the desk to a specific project root.
